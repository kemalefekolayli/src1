Created a basic back end project using javascript, node.js postgresql and certain libraries.
I basically tried to create a system where an admin can add drivers, assign those drivers to vehicles which can be assigned to garages to create voyages. There certain other things you could do. I've also did some admin authetication using middlewares
and a login and register system that utilizes tokens and hashed passwords. It's all a mess but a good place to start learning.
